# Virtual-Assistant
**MOTIVATION** : I made this project to collect data from two most popular sites and get results from them in the same window prompt.

For this program we need some of *pip* so we have to install them in our machines.  
Installing *pip* is very easy and straighforward.  
**FOR WINDOWS** : In windows pip already came installed with python.  
**FOR MAC** : Go to your application and open the terminal and type (sudo easy_install pip)  
**FOR LINUX** : Go to the terminal and type (sudo apt-get install pip)  

We are going to use *Wikipedia* and *Wolframalpha* APIs to collect data.

After you have installed *pip* just types these in your *terminal* :

pip install wikipedia  
pip install wolframalpha  

**How to creat AppID on Wolframalpha** : https://products.wolframalpha.com/short-answers-api/documentation/  

***Main Motive Behind these applications are ***:  

1. *Using wikipedia for extracting the result of our query*
2. *Getting data from Wolframalpha*
3. *Creating a GUI ( Graphical User Interface)*
4. *WxPython gives our application a window*
                                          
**You will need some more packages of which you can see on thier respective sites how to install them.**   

***I am providing the link to those sites down below*** :

1. *Text to Speech(pyttsx3)* - https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/  
2. *For Prompt Window( WxPython)* - https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/  
3. *If you wanted to play with Text to Speech code* : https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/engine.html#module-pyttsx3.voice  
                                                  
    
Most of details of command that i am using in code i have already shown in the form of comment inside code file after each line of code.
