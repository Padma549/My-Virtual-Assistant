# Virtual-Assistant
MOTIVATION : I made this project to collect data from two most popular sites and get results from them in the same window prompt.

For this program we need some of pip so we have to install them in our machines.
Installing pip is very easy and straighforward.__
FOR WINDOWS : In windows pip already came installed with python.__
FOR MAC : Go to your application and open the terminal and type (sudo easy_install pip)__
FOR LINUX : Go to the terminal and type (sudo apt-get install pip)

We are going to use Wikipedia and Wolframalpha APIs to collect data.

After you haveinstalled pip just types these in your terminal :

pip install wikipedia__
pip install wolframalpha__

Main Motive Behind these applications are :

Using wikipedia for extracting the result of our query
Getting data from Wolframalpha
Creating a GUI ( Graphical User Interface)
WxPython gives our application a window
                                          
You will need some more packages of which you can see on thier respective sites how to install them.
I am providing the link to those sites down below :

Text to Speech(pyttsx3) - https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/
For Prompt Window( WxPython) - https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/
If you wanted to play with Text to Speech code:https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/engine.html#module-pyttsx3.voice
                                                  
    
Most of details of command that i am using in code i have already shown in the form of comment inside code file after each line of code.
