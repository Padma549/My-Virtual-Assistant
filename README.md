# Virtual-Assistant

For this program we need some of pip so we have to install them in our machines.
Installing pip is very easy and straighforward.
FOR WINDOWS : In windows pip already came installed with python.
FOR MAC : Go to your application and open the terminal and type (sudo easy_install pip)
FOR LINUX : Go to the terminal and type (sudo apt-get install pip)

We are going to use Wikipedia and Wolframalpha APIs to collect data.

After you haveinstalled pip just types these in your terminal :
                                                               a. pip install wikipedia
                                                               b. pip install wolframalpha
Main Motive Behind these applications are :
                                           a. Using wikipedia for extracting the result of our query
                                           b. Getting data from Wolframalpha
                                           c. Creating a GUI ( Graphical User Interface)
                                           d. WxPython gives our application a window
                                          
You will need some more packages of which you can see on thier respective sites how to install them.
I am providing the link to those sites down below :

Most of details of command that i am using in code i have already shown in the form of comment inside code file after each line of code.
